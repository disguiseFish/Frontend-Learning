You can do some really cool things with infer in TypeScript. If you say infer value from color here, we've got a generic type here that takes in color. There has to be a string here.

This is a type being passed to another type. And then we check if color matches this little pattern here.

Infer N extracts the namespace. Infer color extracts the color. And infer t extracts the tone here.

So, we end up with namespace, color, and tone being saved in an object. If it doesn't match this, then we get never back.

So the example here, where we infer value from color, text-green-300. Boom! It's all working. If we change this to red, and this will work.

And if we remove one of the dashes here, let's just say -300, then it's going to return never because it doesnâ€™t match the pattern.

So it's like pattern matching on the type level in TypeScript. And you can use it to transform a string into an object. Crazy.
