# JS event polling mechanism

Explain concepts

The JavaScript Event Loop is an asynchronous programming model for handling events and callbacks in JavaScript. This event polling mechanism enables single-threaded JavaScript to handle multiple tasks, thus enabling asynchronous programming.

Detailed answer

In browsers, the JavaScript event polling mechanism is executed by the browser's Event Loop. This Event Loop is a mechanism that continuously checks a Task Queue and executes tasks from the queue sequentially.

In JavaScript, tasks can be divided into two types: Macro tasks and Micro tasks.

Macro tasks usually include operations that take a long time, such as timers, event callbacks, and so on. When a macro task has finished executing, the JavaScript engine checks for any unexecuted microtasks and, if so, executes them immediately. After all the microtasks have been executed, the JavaScript engine starts executing macro tasks again.

Microtasks usually include operations that need to be performed as quickly as possible, such as a Promise callback, a MutationObserver callback, and so on. A microtask can be registered using the then() method of a Promise object or the observe() method of a MutationObserver.

In JavaScript, the event polling mechanism is executed in the following order:

1. Execute the synchronization code in the current macro task until the first macro task or microtask is encountered.
2. If a microtask is encountered, it is added to the microtask queue and the next synchronization code is executed.

3. If you encounter a macro task, you add it to the macro task queue and proceed to the next synchronization code.
