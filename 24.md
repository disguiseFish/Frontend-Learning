# Implement deep copy
  Shallow copy: Shallow copy refers to copying the attribute value of one object to another object. If the attribute value is a reference type, then the address of the reference is copied to the object, so the two objects will have a reference of the same reference type. Shallow copying can be implemented using Object.assign() and the spread operator.
