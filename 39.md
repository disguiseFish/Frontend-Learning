# What is document preparsing?
 
 Both Webkit and Firefox have implemented this optimization. When JavaScript scripts are being executed, another thread parses the remainder of the document and loads resources that need to be fetched over the network. This approach allows resources to be loaded in parallel, thereby speeding up the overall process. It's important to note that preparsing does not alter the DOM tree; it leaves this task to the main parsing process, focusing solely on parsing references to external resources, such as external scripts, stylesheets, and images.

 # How does CSS block document parsing?
In theory, since style sheets don't change the DOM tree, there's no need to stop parsing documents and wait for them. One problem, however, is that JavaScript script execution may request style information during the parsing of the document, and if the style has not been loaded and parsed, the script will get the wrong value, which obviously will cause many problems. Therefore, if the browser has not finished downloading and building the CSSOM, and we attempt to run the script at this point, the browser will delay JavaScript script execution and document parsing until the CSSOM is completely downloaded and built. This means that, in such cases, the browser will first download and build the CSSOM, then execute the JavaScript, and finally continue with the parsing of the document.
