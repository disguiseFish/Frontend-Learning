# Understanding of Service Worker
A Service Worker is a separate thread that runs behind the browser and can generally be used to implement caching functions. To use a Service Worker, the transport protocol must be HTTPS. This is because the Service Worker involves request interception, which requires HTTPS protocol to ensure the security.

The Service Worker implements the cache function in three steps: First of all, you need to register the Service Worker, and then after listening to the 'install' event, you can cache the required files. Then, when the user visits the next time, you can check whether there is a cache by intercepting the request. If there is a cache, you can directly read the cached files, otherwise you will request data. Here is the implementation of the steps:

// index.js
if (navigator.serviceWorker) {
  navigator.serviceWorker
    .register('sw.js')
    .then(function(registration) {
      console.log('service worker 注册成功')
    })
    .catch(function(err) {
      console.log('servcie worker 注册失败')
    })
}
// sw.js
// 监听 `install` 事件，回调中缓存所需文件
// Listen for the 'install' event and cache the required files in the callback
self.addEventListener('install', e => {
  e.waitUntil(
    caches.open('my-cache').then(function(cache) {
      return cache.addAll(['./index.html', './index.js'])
    })
  )
})
// 拦截所有请求事件
// Block all request events
// 如果缓存中已经有请求的数据就直接用缓存，否则去请求数据
// If the requested data already exists in the cache, use the cache; otherwise, request the data
self.addEventListener('fetch', e => {
  e.respondWith(
    caches.match(e.request).then(function(response) {
      if (response) {
        return response
      }
      console.log('fetch source')
    })
  )
})

Open the page and you can see that the Service Worker has started in the 'Application' tab of the developer tools:

It can also be found in the 'Cache' section that the required files have been cached:
