# Print red, yellow and green

A typical problem to compare several asynchronous programming methods: red light is on for 3 seconds, green light for 1 second, and yellow light for 2 seconds. How can we make the three lights continuously alternate in a repeating sequence?

Three lighting functions:


function red() {
    console.log('red');
}
function green() {
    console.log('green');
}
function yellow() {
    console.log('yellow');
}

The complexity of this problem is that it requires "alternating repeated" lighting, rather than "lighting once" and then ending.

(1) Implement with callback

const task = (timer, light, callback) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (light === 'red') {
            red()
        }
        else if (light === 'green') {
            green()
        }
        else if (light === 'yellow') {
            yellow()
        }
        callback()
    }, timer)
}
task(3000, 'red', () => {
    task(2000, 'green', () => {
        task(1000, 'yellow', Function.prototype)
    })
})

There is a bug here: the code only completes the process once, and the red, yellow and green lights only once after execution. How do you make it alternate?

Recursion mentioned above can recursively light a period:
const step = () => {
    task(3000, 'red', () => {
        task(2000, 'green', () => {
            task(1000, 'yellow', step)
        })
    })
}
step()

Notice that in the callback of the yellow light, the step method is called again to complete the cyclic lighting.

(2) Implement with promises
const task = (timer, light) => 
    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            if (light === 'red') {
                red()
            }
            else if (light === 'green') {
                green()
            }
            else if (light === 'yellow') {
                yellow()
            }
            resolve()
        }, timer)
    })
const step = () => {
    task(3000, 'red')
        .then(() => task(2000, 'green'))
        .then(() => task(2100, 'yellow'))
        .then(step)
}
step()

This version removes the callback, resolving the promise at the end of each lighting sequence and using recursion to continue the cycle.

(3) Implement with async/await

const taskRunner =  async () => {
    await task(3000, 'red')
    await task(2000, 'green')
    await task(2100, 'yellow')
    taskRunner()
}
taskRunner()
