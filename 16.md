# The difference between 'for in' and 'for of'

Both for...in and for...of are loop statements in JavaScript, but they differ slightly in function and usage.

The for...in loop is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object, iterating through each property name (or key name) of the object as an iterative variable. Here is the basic syntax for for...in:

In this code, variable represents the name (or key name) of the current property in each iteration, while object refers to the object being traversed. For example:

const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
for (const key in obj) {
 console.log(key, obj[key]);
}

Output of the result:
It should be noted that the for...in loop iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, including both its own properties and inherited properties. Therefore, it is not suitable for iterating over arrays and array-like objects.

The for...of loop is used to iterate over the elements of an iterable object, treating each element of the object as an iteration variable. Here is the basic syntax for for...of:

for (variable of iterable) {
 // 在此处编写循环体语句
}

In this code, variable represents the value of the current element in each iteration, and iterable refers to the iterable object to be traversed, such as arrays, strings, Sets, Maps, etc. For example:


const arr = [1, 2, 3];
for (const item of arr) {
 console.log(item);
}

Output of the result:
1
2
3

It should be noted that the for...of loop can only iterate over objects that implement the Iterator interface, therefore it is not suitable for regular objects. Additionally, it iterates over the element values of the object, rather than key names or property names.

To summarize, for...in is suitable for traversing an object's property names, whereas for...of is suitable for iterating over the element values of iterable objects, such as arrays and strings.
